# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Welcome to my website âœ¨

I am a second-year joint PhD student at the [University of Surrey](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/) (UoS), United Kingdom, and the [University of Wollongong](https://www.uow.edu.au/) (UoW), Australia, focusing on resource- and data-efficient methods for 3D scene understanding. My research is supervised by [Xiatian Zhu](https://x-up-lab.github.io/) and [Lu Yin](https://luuyin.com/) at UoS, and by [Salim Bouzerdoum](https://scholars.uow.edu.au/a-bouzerdoum) and [Son Lam Phung](https://documents.uow.edu.au/~phung) at UoW.

Before embarking on my PhD journey, I had the privilege of working at [Mohammed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/) in Abu Dhabi, where I was fortunate to collaborate with [Salman Khan]() and [Fahad Khan]() on developing foundational models for continual learning and continual point cloud segmentation using indoor datasets. Prior to joining MBZUAI, I gained valuable experience as a freelancer, contributing to diverse projects across research and industry. During this period, I also collaborated with esteemed institutions such as CERN, UIUC, and the University of Cambridge.

I completed my bachelor's degree in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from [SGGS Institute of Engineering and Technology Nanded](https://www.sggs.ac.in/) in India. As part of my undergraduate programme, I had the incredible opportunity to spend six months at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) (NTU), Singapore, where I worked with [Meiqing Wu](https://openreview.net/profile?id=~Meiqing_Wu1) and [Lam Siew Kei](https://siewkeilam.github.io/ei-research-group/index.html) on unsupervised domain adaptation for autonomous driving applications.

<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
